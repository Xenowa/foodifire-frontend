## Project Details

### Technologies used

- ReactJS + MUI

### How It Works

Upon launching the application, first the user provides the disease conditions
that he faces to the application. Next when the user takes an image of a food
source he is about to consume, the image is transfered to the NodejS backend
via a POST Request. This will trigger the servers TensorflowJS Machine
Learning model to predict the image source and generate a food label. Then
the food label is sent as a query from the server to the mongodb database
server, where it will return back the diseases related to the food label.
Finally the Server will send back a JSON response containing the food label
and the relevant diseases to the frontend, where a report will be generated
by comparing user provided disease conditions with the fetched disease
conditions.

### Usage

1. Clone the Repository

2. To Launch the frontend

```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Start using the application

## Contributing

1. Pull new changes to master branch

```cmd
git pull
```

2. Create a new branch

```cmd
git checkout -b yourName-dev
```

3. For frontend, always create new features or changes in the **tempFrontendComponents** directory

```

```

4. Stage, commit and push the branch

```cmd
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
git push
```

5. Create a pull request in github (DO NOT MERGE)

6. switch to main branch and Delete the local branch

```cmd
git checkout master
git branch -d yourName-dev
```
